# Payload Download Cradles 
This are different types of download cradles which should be an inspiration to play and create new download cradles to bypass 
AV/EPP/EDR in context of download cradle detections. Notice, removing or obfuscating signatures from your download cradle is 
only one piece of the puzzle to bypass an AV/EPP/EDR. Depending on the respective product you have to modify your payload which 
should be downloaded by the cradle to bypass API-Hooking, Callbacks, AMSI etc. 

Creds to Daniel Bohannon for his amazing obfuscation tools, many thanks to Daniel.
